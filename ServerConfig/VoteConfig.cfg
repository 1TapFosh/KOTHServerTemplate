// KOTH NOTES:
// ====================================================================================================================================
// Start on Sumari KOTH, the greatest seeding layer ever. It has no "Heavy" vehicles or helicopters, just light vics, HALOs, and MSVs. 
// This version has no bots, as players prefer to just walk around getting free money rather than fighting bots. 
// This sounds "broken", but they will get bored and fight eachother, and whoever seeds the server deserves their free digital KOTH money to do whatever they want.
// Roll to Live layers after 25 players, as we have maps like Fallujah in the vote pool for seeding and some with heavy vics (Narva) anyways, may as well offer the bigger maps once there is enough ppl to scrim.
